The model delivers a clustering and classification accuracy of 96.91% Â± 2.0%, successfully identifying whether a nozzle is clogged or unclogged during the extrusion of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). When tested against real nozzle conditions, this method supports real-time detection of irregularities by monitoring variations in filament feed rate and flow uniformity. It reduces material waste, enhances predictive maintenance, and supports prompt decision-making in the fabrication process, while boosting manufacturing dependability through adaptable, hardware-independent automation.
